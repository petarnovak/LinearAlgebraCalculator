# Linear Algebra Calculator
## Features
This application can be used to:
- solve system of linear equations (multiple variables and multiple equations)
- calculate matrix properties (such as rank, determinant, echelon form, inverse matrix ect.)
- perform matrix operations (addition , substraction, multiplication).

## About
This application has been made using .NET Core 3.1. GUI has been made using Windows Forms.

LinearAlgebra project in this solution is a class library modeling math concepts like matrix and system of linear equations. After buidling the solution you can use `LinearAlgebra.dll` seperatly in another project.

Output for Setup project in this solution is `Setup.msi` file which can be used to easily install this application on a Windows PC.

## To do
- Add config options so things like maximum matrix size and text in help panel are not hard coded.
